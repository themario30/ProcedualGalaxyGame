# ProcedualGalaxyGame

## What is this program?
This is a idea that I had one evening. What if I was able to procedually generata a galaxy with its own lore, as deep as Dwarf Fortress?  Each world has its own lore, which interact with the lore of the entire galaxy? Implement elements of both sci-fi and fantasy, just like Warhammer 40k. How complicated can it become?

##Proof of Concept
-Genesis of the universe
-Genesis of the galaxy
-Create hundreds of systems, each with its own lore
-How does civilizations affect the galaxy?
-How does deities affect the galaxy?
-How does natural events affect the galaxy?
-Can an indivudal affect their civlization, or even their own galaxy?
-Intergalactic Contacts?
-Does the lore go through each year, or millions of years?
-Magic?

These are the ideas which I've thought of when I thought of a galaxy with its lore. How big or small will the galaxy be with it's own lore. I shall be implementing these features into the program, and see how far I can go given my limited knowledge of coding and project management.
